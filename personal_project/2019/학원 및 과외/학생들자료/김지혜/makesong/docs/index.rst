.. rubric:: Make music with Python.

Pyknon is a simple music library for Python hackers. With Pyknon you
can generate Midi files quickly and reason about musical
proprieties. It works with Python 2.6, 2.7, and 3.2.

Pyknon has modules for different things. I recommend you start by
checking the section :ref:`tutorial`. It's a hands on approach on how
to use this library.

You'll almost always want to work with the modules :mod:`music` and
:mod:`genmidi` (see section :ref:`music`).

The module :mod:`simplemusic` is a simple numeric library for music
operations. It's intended mainly for teaching because it's simple. If
you want to learn more about Set Theory in Music, you may want to look
at the module :mod:`pcset` (see section :ref:`simplemusic`)
